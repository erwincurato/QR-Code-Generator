# QR-Code-Generator

This is my first React practice project.  
It’s a simple QR Code Generator where you can enter a URL and generate a scannable QR code.  
- I think the file structure is messy.
- The code is not optimized yet.
- This is just my first React practice project.

✨ Features
- Generate QR codes from any link
- Download QR codes as PNG
- Responsive design
- Built with React and CSS
